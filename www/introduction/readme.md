## Installation
By default the `latest` major version of `Crayons` will be installed. If you want to install any specific version of `Crayons` please use `crayons@version`

## Getting Started

#### Usage via CDN
From your appâ€™s root `html` file add the following scripts: 

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@freshworks/crayons@3/dist/crayons/crayons.esm.js">
</script>
<script
  nomodule
  src="https://unpkg.com/@freshworks/crayons@3/dist/crayons/crayons.js">
</script>
```

You can now use the Crayons components just like how you would use any other html element.

```html live
<fw-button color="secondary" onclick="alert('Button Clicked')">Get Started</fw-button>
```

You can use [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) to query specific versions in your app.

#### Usage via Node Modules
 - Install the package 
```bash
  npm install @freshworks/crayons@3 --save
```
 - Put a script tag similar to this 
```html
<script src='node_modules/@freshworks/crayons/dist/crayons.js'></script>
``` 
in the head of your index.html
 - Now you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc.

## Framework Bindings

The `@freshworks/crayons` package can be used in simple HTML, or by vanilla JavaScript without any framework at all. `Crayons v3` also provides framework bindings that make it easier to integrate Crayons into a framework such as **React**. (However, at the lowest-level framework bindings are still just using Crayons core and Web Components).

To use **React wrapper** use below:
```js
import { FwButton } from "@freshworks/crayons/react"
```

## Adding CSS Utils

`Crayons v3` also provides a set of CSS utilities to help with application development. You can use these utils by adding 'crayons-min.css' file in your app. 

#### Usage via Node Modules
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@freshworks/crayons/css/crayons-min.css">
```
#### Usage via CDN
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@freshworks/crayons@3/css/crayons-min.css">
```

> Note: CSS utils are optional. Crayons can be used without including crayons-min.css.

## Why Web Components?

All the crayons components are built as web compponents.

Web components provides a way to create our own HTML elements and use them in any framework.

With every growing popularity of frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular component driven development has become a need. Components help us encapsulate styles and behaviors into reusable blocks. 

Drawbacks with Framework specific components:

  - The components can only be used in their specific framework.
  - Any new framework or version changes can lead to breaking changes and require substantial effort to update the components.
  - Web components solve these problems. 
    - They're supported by all modern browsers.
    - They're framework agnostic.
    - They're a part of the web standard.
